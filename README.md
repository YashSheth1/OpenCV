These Are some of the projects i've been working on.
1. MOTION DETECT: self explainatory
2. Harris_corner_from_image: detcts corners in any image,i've given a sample image of a chess board to so as to make it easier to understand
3. Harris_corner_from_webcam: detects corners by taking images from your webcam.
4. colordetect_blue : is used to detect colors ,i've made it for blue ypu can modify to suit your needs by changing the RGB values accordingly
5. Circle on Click: it opens up a black window and lets you draw circle on the click of the mouse, it can be further modified to draw different shapes and recognise different mouse clicks.
6. Edge detection: this code detects the edges on the images produced by your webcam 
7. circle detection: it is ongoing project, and there are some errors which i need to rectify before publishing it for you guys but till then you can use this code to as a reference for your knowledge.
